              This past summer, I embarked on my first professional software
              engineering journey at Travelers in Hartford, CT. I had the
              privilege of working as part of the Digital Enablement Team, where
              I contributed to deploying an internal application designed to
              streamline the management of IVR call centers utilized by
              insurance claim agents. This project gave me hands-on experience
              in building impactful solutions that directly supported business
              operations and customer interactions.

              Throughout my time at Travelers, I was fortunate to be part of a
              dynamic, supportive, and collaborative team. The teamâ€™s welcoming
              environment and focus on mentorship allowed me to grow both
              technically and professionally. Working closely with experienced
              engineers, I gained valuable insights into software development
              best practices, Agile methodologies, and the importance of
              user-centered design in crafting effective tools.

              environment. My time at Travelers was truly transformative,
              leaving me excited to continue pursuing impactful projects in
